# Project 6: Application Security - Delta Dental
Challenge: Research a real-world security breach.

Context: For this project, I researched the Delta Dental security breach to understand how it happened and what could have been done to prevent it. The goal was to apply application security principles to a real incident.

Action: I looked into how the breach occurred, what data was exposed, and what security practices were missing or weak. I then analyzed how better authentication, encryption, and access controls could have helped.

Result: The most difficult part was finding reliable sources and understanding the technical side of the breach. After gathering enough information, I was able to connect it to the security concepts we studied.

Reflection: This project helped me understand how real companies can be affected by poor security and how important it is to apply secure coding and design practices from the start.
